OFFICIAL ProjectG EDITED WITH LORDPE

Step One: Compile ProjectG.dll with visual studio 2017 or later
See if you can see DLL functions by using the dllexp.exe program
if something like "TrinngilingPv @ 4" appears your dll is ready

Second step
Open ProjectG.exe with some preferred hexaeditor, in hexaeditor look for: "_Z11TrinngilingPv@4" and swap for: "TrinngilingPv@4"


after that just test :)
